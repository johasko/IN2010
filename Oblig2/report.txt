1. What is the time complexity of your solution? You must explain the stated complexity. If you have a different complexity for each problem, you need to discuss them separately.

2. What requirements are there for the input graph in order for the project to be successfully planned? Please put the discussion in the light of graf theoretical properties.

3. What kind of the graph algorithms did you use in your implementation?
Topologisk sortering for å sortere tasks etter avhengighet til hverandre, Dijkstras Algoritme i early- og lateStart for å finne
tidligste og seneste start for hver task.
